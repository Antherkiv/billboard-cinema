First at all, this project is building and not completed now. 

It's intended to be a monorepo that stores microservices written in python:

1. Registration and authentication
2. Movie description
3. Comments (Generic comments)

I'm testing a little bit with falcon and related code.

And it web mashup with following characteristics:

1. ES6 - ES7 as loading language
2. React as render engine
3.- react-waterfall (or redux if time it's not helping)

I need to be emphatical it's imcomplete
